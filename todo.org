** TODO Setup hspec
** TODO Initial balance tests

** TODO Generate initial macaroon secret 

** TODO Backer balance

- Added to by subscriptions and donations
- No expiry, used to calculate subscription levels daily
- Postings may not sum to zero...  
  
*** How to update this table reliably?



** TODO Calculate effective subscription level

- User could have donated multiple times
- Depending on how much they've donated in total,
  determine current subscription level.
  
For example:

User A donates 1000 bits on 2019-01-01 
User A donates 4000 bits on 2019-01-29

If Tier is 5000 bits per month, they should have access to that their.

select sum(amount)
from donation_balance

Tier levels: 1000, 5000, 10 000, 100 000

4999 -> tier level 1000
5500 -> tier level 5000
9999 -> tier level 5000
  
** TODO Stacked subscriptions

If you donate beyond the subscription levels, it should be smart enough to 

Max tier level is 10,000 bits

User A donates 100,000 bits

Situation A:

  User A donates 20,000 bits valid_until m
  User A donates 20,000 bits valid_until m+1
  User A donates 20,000 bits valid_until m+2

Ideas:

All donations sum to a balance.

60,000 (situation A balance)

Every day, same time, we check to see if any of the donations have expired.

If so, subtract that donation amount from the user's donation balance

donation_balance

  +20,000  ; User A donates 20,000 bits valid_until a
  -20,000  ; 20,000 bit donation expires

** TODO Re-subscribe email

- Email invoice with amount needed to maintain current subscription level
- This implies that we know when the subscription level changes

- Calculate how much bits are needed to maintain the current tier level for
  another month

- If donation_balance is below the current user tier/subscription level, send
  resubscribe email

- Resubscribe email will include bolt11 invoice with the amount needed to
  maintain current subscription level
  
- It may also provide invoices for the next tier level or previous tier level
  
- If dontation_balance is above the current tier level, bump user tier if
  needed, and don't bother sending an email.
